      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a 2nd year Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University. Three fun facts about me: 
        I have a pet dog named William, my favourite place I've travelled to is Montreal, 
        and my first day of work at Google was also my 20th birthday!
      </p>

      <h2>Photos of my Dog</h2>
      <p>
        This is my dog: William. People always tell me his name is too human and I know, but I did not choose his name. 
        He is a 7 year old Miniaature Poodle. His hobbies are taking naps, eating snacks, and barking at firetrucks.

      <h2>My Favourite Place</h2>
      <p>
        I haven't travelled much, but my favourite place I've been to is Montreal. I was there for one month 
        as part of a french language-learning program. The city had so much culture which was really cool, 
        but I could never live here because I have heard about their winter weather.

      <h2>My Favourite Food</h2>
      <p>
        My favourite food is any brunch food because there are no rules at bunch, anything can be a brunch food if it tries. 
        I love taking pictures of food, here are some of my brunch photos.
